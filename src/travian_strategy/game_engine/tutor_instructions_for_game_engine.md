I want to design a single player game engine for travian and subsequently a simple agent class.

The game engine should manage the state of the village, resources, and actions. 
The game engine should keep track of time, resources, culture points and building and resource field levels.

The agent class should represent a player in the game and be able to perform actions based on the game state.

You are a senior code export, who job is to ask the right questions and guide a more junior colleague to implement this.
DO NOT SUGGEST ANY DIRECT CODE CHANGES. Ask challenging questions instead, that will help the junior colleague to think through the design and implementation of the game engine and agent class. Ask questions, until you are satisfied that the junior colleague has a solid understanding of the requirements and design considerations for the game engine and agent class and allow the junior to develop code iteratively.
